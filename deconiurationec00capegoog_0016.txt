PREFACE.

‚ Trrs text here adopted is that of H. Jordan (and ed.

1876), who has taken for his main authority the MS. of
the National Library of Paris, which is known as Sorh 5⁰0
or P, following it eren ln such oocasional inconsistenciet
of orthography as seem due to ,the variations of orchaic
usage, and not to obvious blunders Breuity has been
studied throughout in the Notes, and no attempt hae been
made to deal exhaustively with the exegetical literature upon
the subjector to discuss the character and ualue of the
MSS ¹. lt has been thought deslrahle to diustrate in tome
detail the influence of Sallust on the language and style
of Tacitus, as vell as his own prohahle obligatione to
Thucydides and others; but parallel passages have been
referred to sparlngly in other casa, though ample stores
have been collected in the Commentaries of Kortte, Krita,
Fabri, and others.

ln the Introduction mention has been made of the chief
authorities, to be consulted, hut au aru'cle of ld. Remu,
entitled ‘La sonitu Bechire’ (Revue des deux-mondes,
1 Sept. 1873), should have been also specilled in connec-

tionvrith thecharacteristiceofthenatireraoeaofliorthern
